large companies.

Update 07/18/2013
-----------------
The search functionality now works with an individual's name.  Its not perfect but based on the results the webpage returns jigsaw.rb can tell the difference between a search for a company or a person.  If a search for a person was provided all results are pulled down and displayed along with their name, title, company, city, state, and jigsawID.

	Example:
		./jigsaw.rb -s "Mark Maxey"
		Challenge not broken, attempting anyway.  Hold on to your butts!

	Extracting 304 records from 7 pages

	Dumped 10 records


Update 07/08/2013
-----------------
Small update for version 1.5.1.  It appears they are no longer using the bot_mitigation_token.  At the moment it looks like they are simply accepting scripted requests as is.  This is strange, we'll see how long this lasts...


Update 06/11/2013
-----------------
New version 1.5 is out.  with added 'breakbot.rb' library which tricks the Jigsaw server
into thinking we are a user on a browser and not an automated tool.  This allows us to do what ever
we want and not get stoped/blocked by their WAF

New Features:

	-Proxy support!  This allows you to run jigsaw through an HTTP proxy such as burp for further analysis or 
		staying annonymous

	-Debugging.  Now you can view each HTTP request/response if you want to troubleshoot the next time
		they figure out somethign to stop the tool


Update 10/20/2012
-----------------
Try the -d option to specify a domain to use to craft emails with

Example1:
---------
	$ ./jigsaw -s Google
	Your search returned more then one company
	Jigsaw ID: 215043	- Google, Inc.	6,627 employees.
	Jigsaw ID: 224667	- Google Postini Services	149 employees.
	Jigsaw ID: 439035	- AdMob Google Inc	2 employees.
	Jigsaw ID: 5032028	- Google Inc	1 employees.


Example2:
---------
	./jigsaw.rb -i 23522 -d accuvant.com -r Accuvant
	Extracting 314 records from 7 pages
	Generating the final Accuvant.csv report
	Wrote 310 records to Accuvant.csv
